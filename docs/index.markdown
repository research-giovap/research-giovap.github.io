I'm a **PhD student** in Industrial and Management Engineering at ["La Sapienza" University of Rome](https://www.dima.uniroma1.it/dima/en) and a research collaborator at the [Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology (IBFM-CNR)](https://www.cnr.it/en/institute/009). My research interests span medical imaging, radiomics, machine learning and deep learning.  
I'm interested in building robust and optimzed **radiomics workflows** able to solve several clinical classification tasks and in building **automated radiomics pipelines**, mostly through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  

Currently, my PhD focuses on **Personalized medicine for the diagnosis and prognosis of oncological and neurodegenerative diseases: Radiomics and Artificial Intelligence to support clinical decision-making** and I've been working on the development of the new radiomics freeware named **[matRadiomics](https://doi.org/10.3390/jimaging8080221)** .  
During my activity as a research collaborator at the IBFM, I mentored 2 master degree students and participated in the 1st International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Radiomics in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (AIRCAD).
